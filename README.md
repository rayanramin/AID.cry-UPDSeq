**Functions/scripts used in the AID.cry UPD-Seq publication**

Step1: Do the Sequence alignment and create .bam files    
Step2: use GCmmDepth to extract depth of coverage after applying the GCmm Filter    
Step3: Calculate Differential Coverage using the NDC2 fuction       
Step4: Find peaks using a threshold (5x the standard deviation of NDC output)       
Step5: Extract nucleotide counts using XXX      
Step6: Calculate UI and perform the Analysis
